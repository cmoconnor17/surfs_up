# ** Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis **

		## ** Overview **
	The Purpose of this analysis is to determine the economics, trends and potentials for increased earnings and/or improvement for the designated areas.

		### ** Analysis: **

	Although not overwhelmingly suprising totals for rides and drivers based on areas is what one would expect. Although it does seem quite skewed for urban segment.

Trips:		  Drivers:

Rural        125  Rural      537
Suburban    8570  Suburban   625
Urban       1625  Urban      59,602


	What is also not overwhelmingly suprising is the dollar value of all trips trips in the designated areas as seen below.

Rural total fare value      $  4,327.93 
Suburban total fare value   $ 19,356.33
Urban total fare value      $ 39,854.38

	What is somewhat suprising and yet not at the same time is the average fare per driver. One would presume that the urban area would probably have a lower average as there are more drivers. However not to the extreme as seen in this analysis.

Rural average fare per driver 	 ~ $8.06
Suburban average fare per driver ~ $2.26
Urban average fare per driver 	 ~ $0.67

	As we can see there is quite a drastic variance in the average fare per driver. We did notice this similarity when it came to the variance in the number of drivers. 

	What is interesting starts appearing when the average fare per trip seen below is reviewed.

	Rural       ~ $34.62
	Suburban    ~ $30.97
	Urban       ~ $24.53


## ** Analysis Improvement Possibilities: **

Although a fairly thorough analysis has been completed a deeper dive into the data may be required to formulate a more comprehensive analysis as well as reccomendations for areas of improvement.

Some of the questions that arise are as follows:
1) How many drivers are "Active"?
2) How many drivers are "Active" at any given time or date?
3) What cities, towns or regions are generating the fares plus #2?
4) What specific time frames e.g. 6PM to 8PM, 9PM to 12PM have the most amount of fares?
5) As this is a ride share analysis how many riders are per trip or fare?

	## ** Reccomendations: **

	As seen above the most lucrative area for the business itself is obviously the Urban area as it has the most fares as well as the highest dollar value per region.
This is stifled however if one were to look at this from the driver perspective. At $0.67 per fare this is not an appealing incentive to drive in urban areas.

Some suggestions based on the results of the analysis are as follows:

1) Limit the total amount of drivers in the urban area/city.
2) Limit the total "Acvtive" drivers per time slot in each urban area/city.
3) Limit the total amount of drivers in the suburban area/city.
4) Limit the total "Acvtive" drivers per time slot in each suburban area/city.
5) Per #2 increase the fare cost in times of high demand.
