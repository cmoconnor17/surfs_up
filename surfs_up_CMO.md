# ** Surf Shop Analysis **


		## ** Overview **
	The Purpose of this analysis is to determine if the Surf and Ice Cream Shop are feasible as a year round business.

		### ** Analysis: **

	During this analysis a very large amount of gaps were determined. Although the client only wanted data summarized two months, June and December. 
This left 10 other months out of the picture for the analysis.

The key factors that were focused on for the two months were
	* The number of days in each month that had data or temperatures
	* The average temperature for all the data in the designated month(s)
	* The maximum temperature for all the data in the designated month(s)
	* The minimum temperature for all the data in the designated month(s)

* The number of temperatures counted for the month of June was 1700 and for December was 1517.
* The average temperatures had a difference of approximately 
* The maximum temperatures had a very slight, 2 degree, difference between the months. June had a maximum of 85 and December 83.
* The minimum temperatures had a slightly higher difference of 8 degrees. 64 for June and 56 for December.


## ** Analysis Summary: **
	The overall analysis is that the business is technically sustainable over the course of the year. This is solely based on the data reviewed.
One should note that this analysis has an overwhelming amount of gaps for this analysis to be truly insightful or even provide a reasonable recommendation
of business stability.


	## ** Reccomendations: **
The recommendations in order to provide a more in depth and informative analysis would be to narrow down the amount of years being reviewed. In this case the data spans from January of 2010
to August of 2017. There is no data for December of 2017 which makes for a gap in comparison. A second recommendation would be to create an anlysis nased on quarters, MoM or even YoY.
A third reccomendation would be to, if possible, determine the tourist activity in the area. This could also lead to potential revenue generating opportunities.
More weather data is not required. In fact seven years, of which there is a year that cannot be equally compared is potentially too much.
